## We can create a set of basic jest tests for our tables [#331](https://github.com/LLazyEmail/react-email-table/issues/331)

the goal is simple - I wanna know that our tables cover basic needs and didn't crash.

I think it's doable with jest. We would need to configure it once; later, it might help us a lot.
for example when we decide to change something - we wouldn't need to be worried if we crash something - we just run our tests and see the results.

Later we can install our module into few other remix-* repositories and try to use our simple components

## Try to run storybook and see if it work [#85](https://github.com/LLazyEmail/react-email-table/issues/85)

boilerplate that I'm using has a lot of cool things for react / frontend developers

- storybook
- github actions
- other automation things
we can try if it works and include it into our development cycle
