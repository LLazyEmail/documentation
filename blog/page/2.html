href="https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-to-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-to-email</a> repository, we created and adapted a few cool things that I want to share with others.</p><p><em>Intro: &quot;I don&#x27;t like a lot to start a new project from scratch.&quot;</em></p><p>So I&#x27;m usually trying to use GitHub search and see what was done by more experienced and crazy developers.</p><p>I find a number of repositories that were doing similar things(parsing markdown). But for different reasons, you can&#x27;t just fork them and make that code work as necessary. So we &quot;steal&quot; some cool implementations and then rewrite them for our needs.</p><p>We have a lot of iterations, and at some point, I realize that every project that was doing a similar parsing for markdown syntax used regex&#x27;es. But they(RegEx&#x27;es) were always highly mixed in their code. long code. smelly code.</p><p>I was like: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to keep it all in one place. It&#x27;s just eating space in my brain. It&#x27;s not easy to test, etc, etc&quot;
and if you know about regular expressions, you probably aware about a lot of memes</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pcfa7nyu3bho4kvvpgc0.jpg" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shrmjpkt0sgbhfbhk3sk.jpg" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rrvpifvcr6vt6cmkluic.jpg" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><strong>Step Zero:</strong> other developers were creating a list of constants and put them into their files. we did it too.</p><p><strong>Step One:</strong> I move out a lot of constants that were representing RegEx strings into a separate file and just import it. fancy!</p><p><strong>Step Two:</strong> move all constants into the package folder and try to create a separate npm package, using Rollup.</p><p>Module structure with Rollup config and a few js files is very simple. Another huge plus you can separate your tests, which is necessary for the future. and I like that it&#x27;s very independent and doing only one thing. nothing more. you can see a structure below</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tb44g6lepdntqc15an80.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>inside &quot;src&quot; i have few files with regular expressions. one file was related to storing default markdown tags that can be used in other projects. another file was related to custom tags that we &quot;invented&quot; for our own needs.</p><p>I also have a separate file for lists only. lists in markdown syntax are pure madness. they should be covered with more tests.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cpjli33loev5fh8z7jpi.gif" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><strong>Step Three:</strong> I realize that I want to contribute something to the world and moved default tags into a separated npm module and a separate GitHub repository.

I was angry and happy at the same time. You can&#x27;t get a result without hitting blockers.</p><p>The next stage was a few months ago. I decided to jump into it. There are no bugs that I can&#x27;t handle :)</p><p>As I was not the leading developer of this branch - I quickly realized that it was a rigid structure for me to follow. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lg66itl8kx0a4fqb0flh.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I will move some components into a sub-module (I will see where this idea brings me.) </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/js65g5dbnfqzkgfojv9x.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>This shouldn&#x27;t be hard. I did it before, with the help of Rollup. So I grabbed my own two years old rollup config that was working with simple react components. And tried to make it work.</p><p>I tried three times -&gt; nothing worked as it should :)</p><p>Well, things changed - my old config didn&#x27;t work well with the new version of Babel and React.Â </p><p>It was time to dig into Rollup and solve this problem.Â </p><p><a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RollupJS</a> is a popular tool and good library that I adore.</p><p>But documentation was really outdatedâ¦ The maintainer of this project has a lot of things to do, so docs have very low priority. </p><p>That is is why capitalism is king, and open source is still slow, weak, and not bringing a lot of money into the system and can&#x27;t support code contributors. </p><p>This was one of the reasons for me thinking about doing a software specifications service. But there is a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karl Huges</a>, with <a href="http://www.writer.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WriterDev</a> website, where you can use his help if you need excellent software documentation.</p><p>And I am not blaming <a href="https://github.com/lukastaegert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lukas Taegert-Atkinson</a>(creator of RollupJS). But if he decides to expand the team that building it, things probably would be much easier.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/snx6j3lcb8zmbyw4gk6m.gif" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I left the task for a few weeks and just explored the internet in a lazy way.</p><p>At one point, <a href="https://github.com/jaebradley/example-rollup-react-component-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I found a repository</a> that sounds reasonable with a config that suits my needs. It even provides room for future growth.</p><p>I was looking for a Rollup setup with Babel and the ability to compile and publish my React components.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes. I&#x27;m aware of <a href="https://bit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bit</a> or other similar tools, but they are somehow against my understanding. Again, I&#x27;m scared of Webpack. I mentioned it a few times on my articles. </p><p>But I&#x27;m still ready for something better. This is why I&#x27;m exploring the <a href="https://lit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lit Library</a> at the same time. It is still not in my arsenal but looks promising.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5frn4uieb6uiu0ayitml.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Separation functionality is one of the things that I&#x27;ve been praising for the last few years, probably because I read a lot of articles on Hackernoon on different languages, platforms, functions, etc. And when your code is tied up with just one project, with just one framework, used only once, it&#x27;s boring, it is life, so I get on with it. </p><p>But where can we find anarchy and punk rock? You can beat the system by benefiting from an open source at the same time.</p><p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/WsvLlmmjx9tnmeTPNc/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://media.giphy.com/media/WsvLlmmjx9tnmeTPNc/giphy.gif</a></p><p>Plus, hard-to-swallow code is usually wrong. Usually hard to cover with tests. Easy to spend a week, just by debugging, patching, and ready to break in the next six months.Â </p><p>Well, it&#x27;s just not for me. Bad code is too easy to build.</p><p>Hopefully, now you&#x27;ll understand a bit my coding philosophy.</p><p>Again, I find <a href="https://github.com/jaebradley/example-rollup-react-component-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an excellent repository</a> with the premade setup as my components have pretty low-level complexity.</p><p>But there is more:</p><ul><li><p>it has pre-made Github actions for publishing on npm</p></li><li><p>storybook for playgrounds</p></li><li><p>and tools that I need when I want a separate module of components that I can easily tweak, extend, publish and install in between projects, repositories.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itu81kmwbzy6kqppp1og.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I did a few iterations there, combined some components, and published them on npm.org.</p><p>But it still does not move forward quickly, as I imagine it in my head.</p><p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/eNGuf8kUCeGrvflJfo/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://media.giphy.com/media/eNGuf8kUCeGrvflJfo/giphy.gif</a></p><p>Let&#x27;s take a break a little bit. There is a default question that my friend Denis asked me.Â </p><p><em>&quot;But emails aren&#x27;t a new problem. React isn&#x27;t a new tool as well. There should probably be plenty of other repositories in GitHub. Did you look at them?&quot;</em></p><p>And I spent a few nights just exploring GitHub and got excited about it.</p><p>But there are always default issues related to using other modules.Â </p><p><em>This is why I like to have separated and independent modules</em></p><p>Yes, there are old, popular repositories that can have similar tools inside. The reason is always simple - they didn&#x27;t fit well to our current code. It is not their fault.</p><p>It&#x27;s a widespread issue - you can&#x27;t easily integrate something great and prebuild with the workflows you have. So instead of trying some of them right now, I&#x27;m just stacking links in my notes.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdbb98rzjv941n6dh6qu.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Even while I have a lot of ideas - the main goal is to make the current project work. Later, when our modules will be mature - we will try to replace some functionality.</p><p>We did it before - a pretty incredible experience.</p><p>I talk about popular repositories to build emails with some algorithms, I mean JS stuff for building emails. It&#x27;s <a href="https://maizzle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maizzle</a>, <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/feature/mjml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MJML</a>, and others. So later, if things go smoothly - we&#x27;ll add a port to those libraries. </p><p>Our email generator is âsyntax agnosticâ. if you learn it, I can generate you HTML, React DOM, XML, or even AST-tree</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gdj25b7j1ljxjtmc8krz.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>One of my concerns is that the current library must be improved. A few great repositories are doing similar things, but they are aging poorly. For sure, it&#x27;s not a problem, but I will make it differently.</p><p>From another side, I want to use their logic and be able to include some of their excellent findings into our core.</p><p>This is why I decided not to have one boring repository and started splitting it.</p><p>I also started a <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new organization on Github</a> as a unique place for several repositories interconnected by email marketing topic and email template generation.</p><p>I split an old repository into a just react components place. And old components were mixed mostly on one template. Now, I want to get a universal version. And by separating inner with outer things, separating default components with Miscellaneous Elements helped to think more widely and make things work together and independently.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oif42hceyf5v3erj116p.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>So if you decide to use our components for your emails, you can install <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail/react-email-table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Table components</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail/react-email-typography-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basic Typography</a> components and use them while not being overwhelmed with other available components (like bid design systems like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ant Design</a>). It was the main image in my head.</p><p><a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NextJS</a> is used as a preview, repositories with separated  components. What is next? Well. I will jump into the next loophole that will distracted me for another few months. it will help me to optimize that code.</p><p>I am going to write more articles about that.</p><p><strong>Related Articles</strong>

I was not happy with how we handle templates in our generator.</p><p>While there are not many things that changed behind how it works, I still want to showcase them in my article.</p><p>All developers work with strings, generating chunks of HTML code. I spend days thinking about how to improve it for our benefit.</p><p>While this version of the template will be obsolete when we upgrade our generator, there is still room to forget some knowledge and learn how to keep things simple and not be seduced by ideas to complete it quickly.</p><p>So we have been working on rendering HTML for a while right now. </p><p>Our HTML template contains an old HTML4 style markup that is very sensitive and requires careful work and attention to small details. I have been asking for help from different developers, but everybody struggles with it from the beginning. </p><p>So we are combining that HTML page from small parts, and for the last nine months, I moved those parts away into a small js module. </p><p>With the help of RollupJS, it&#x27;s easy to work.</p><p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/62g0ie0unri1ad1aoy8k.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I was able to extend it and even clone it. I decided to build a react-dom tree at some point instead of HTML. </p><p>So I copy-pasted everything and replaced my literals with react tags. It looks like âcustom XMLâ, which can be just another way of presenting the information.</p><p>After that, this module didn&#x27;t evolve a lot. Everything was working ok, but not ideally. I tried to expand it and polish our functionality, but things didn&#x27;t move fast. </p><p>This module was located in folder &quot;packages&quot; with other modules that I have.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xqep0y6lxflgsireezp3.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>At this point, I decided that there was a lot of coding, and I was sick of it. So I created a new repository and moved it there. While it was just a copy-paste - it helped me to think differently. I was able to focus only on those 25 files.</p><p>From the beginning, we think about our template in 2 only forms: &quot;content only&quot; and &quot;full template&quot;. Most bugs was in the &quot;content&quot; part, while the main template was pretty stable.

But for different reasons, you can&#x27;t just fork them and make that code work as necessary. So we &quot;steal&quot; some cool implementations and then rewrite them for our needs.</p><p>We have a lot of iterations, and at some point, I realize that every project that was doing a similar parsing for markdown syntax used regex&#x27;es. But they(RegEx&#x27;es) were always highly mixed in their code. long code. smelly code.</p><p>I was like: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to keep it all in one place. It&#x27;s just eating space in my brain. It&#x27;s not easy to test, etc, etc&quot;
and if you know about regular expressions, you probably aware about a lot of memes</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pcfa7nyu3bho4kvvpgc0.jpg" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shrmjpkt0sgbhfbhk3sk.jpg" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rrvpifvcr6vt6cmkluic.jpg" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><strong>Step Zero:</strong> other developers were creating a list of constants and put them into their files. we did it too.</p><p><strong>Step One:</strong> I move out a lot of constants that were representing RegEx strings into a separate file and just import it. fancy!</p><p><strong>Step Two:</strong> move all constants into the package folder and try to create a separate npm package, using Rollup.</p><p>Module structure with Rollup config and a few js files is very simple. Another huge plus you can separate your tests, which is necessary for the future. and I like that it&#x27;s very independent and doing only one thing. nothing more. you can see a structure below</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tb44g6lepdntqc15an80.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>inside &quot;src&quot; i have few files with regular expressions. one file was related to storing default markdown tags that can be used in other projects. another file was related to custom tags that we &quot;invented&quot; for our own needs.</p><p>I also have a separate file for lists only. lists in markdown syntax are pure madness. they should be covered with more tests.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cpjli33loev5fh8z7jpi.gif" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><strong>Step Three:</strong> I realize that I want to contribute something to the world and moved default tags into a separated npm module and a separate GitHub repository.
