The answer is to create a curated newsletter.

## How can I start an email newsletter for a company?

Before a company dives into creating curated newsletters, it needs to have a solid understanding of what an email newsletter is. 

An email newsletter is an email communication that is sent to inform your subscribers about various topics, such as:
- Latest news
- Advice
- Product updates / launches
- Important appointments

These emails can cover general topics and user-generated topics that are sent on a predetermined schedule, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.

Starting an email newsletter isn't all that difficult, especially if you've already created a list of email users. 

From there, you'll simply have to send opt-in emails to your subscribers to make sure they want to receive your marketing materials, and once that's done you can start sending them according to your predetermined schedule.

## How do you make a good newsletter?

What makes a good newsletter really depends on the brand, industry, and target audience. The reason for this is that everyone wants something a little different which is why they choose specific activities to follow.
 
However, there are several ways to help your email marketing team create a newsletter that works well.

### 1. Don't try to sell 

Mentioning a product is one thing, as you will do it during product launches / updates, but it has to be about the reader, not you selling them something.

### 2. Be short and simple 
It must be informative, also encouraging readers to click to learn more.

### 3. Again, you should aim for a click-through

Click through rate (CTR) is the most common metric for measuring engagement within an email campaign. CTR is a metric that measures how many people click through an email in relation to how many emails were delivered. Essentially, the click rate is a percentage that tells you how many emails successfully achieved one click from a subscriber. This click tells you if your campaign was engaging enough to not only entice an open, but also an action from your audience.

### 4. Simplify deactivation(unsubscribe link). 

It is vital to make deactivation easy for those who wish to stop receiving communications.

### 5. Make sure it's compelling.
