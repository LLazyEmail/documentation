        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A story about the need for a <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail/default-email-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default email template package</a>.
From novice developers to experienced ones, most are involved in sending emails programmatically. Sending emails is like building forms: most of the developers involved in building the web did it.</p><ul><li>If you are learning nodeJS, then you probably used nodemailer.</li><li>If you are building your product, I bet you are thinking about connecting your code with SendGrid or MailGun and sending some transactional emails.</li><li>If you are trying to make that sign-up form work and send confirmation emails -&gt; I hear you.</li></ul><p>We have a lot of resources and simple tutorials online that might help you to do such basic things. It is cool that you can read some tutorials, install a few packages and go! </p><p>Even starting with some SAAS boilerplate that removes the first configuration steps and gives you a great jumpstart for your ideas.</p><p>Now you can send your empty email with "Hello world" from your server and be happy when it is delivered to your inbox. And this is where most developers feel that everything is great and stop doing more.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j75251dyexl69wltd3m0.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>And while my module is written in JS, I don't think that it is a hard task to convert it into other languages if someone wants to contribute -&gt; feel free to jump abroad. I’m always friendly to contributors' pull requests.</p><p>Ok, let's try to imagine that you are building your email-related functionality, related to emails from scratch -- you will try to organize email messages in a separate folder, maybe even make it translatable into multi-languages, testing your ability to render it with variables received from other sources...</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z0wyf5qjj04719a7svvq.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>But you will probably never try to send an email with a full template from the beginning.</p><p><strong>But you should do it.</strong> </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a99g4067ltz8jqzao2ay.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>There are a lot of important questions that you have to ask yourself.
<em>Does your email template is good and render all necessary thoughts?</em>
<em>What about images? Do you have a folder with images that is available from outside?</em>
<em>Are all permissions set correctly? (Ie. not only your logo must be visible)</em>
<em>What about links?</em>
<em>What about supporting different email clients? (Yes there is not only your email app that you update frequently.)</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mhrexk9s1f5jsyk4o1dz.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Some people use Thunderbird and it disables image rendering by default (just to let you know). </p><p>All those things might crash your email. Plus, it’s an old HTML4 code, so everything is so fragile.</p><p>I was trying to solve our inner coding problem a few months ago. We had an issue with making email templates to be precise --&gt; we split them into partials, but I still didn't like what my stomach was telling me about manipulating with markup emails.</p><p>But that is a story for another article. And it was time for me to be inspired by other developers.</p><p>I reviewed a few repositories during one night. I found a few basic, but interesting solutions.</p><p>While our render method was working well for our needs -&gt; it didn't give you this feeling of quickly understanding what your code is doing.</p><p>We didn't have it.</p><p>So I saved links and copied a few methods into temporary files.</p><p>It was not enough, especially as our problem was not gone anyway. At that moment I realized that a lot of projects might have similar issues. Imagine this situation: you have your monolith application and you need to send a test email via your Email Transport provider.</p><p>And sending a few blank emails with 2 lines is not enough either. We all need a quick and easy way to do it properly without additional knowledge. One of the best ways is to use a predefined working solution. So I decided to make it an open JS module and easy to use for everyone.</p><p>And I created two repositories for that :)</p><p>The first repository contains 3 files. And it's easy to read. Just a long string aka literal with an email template inside.</p><p>What's good about this repository is that you can install it via npm, use it a few times, while debugging your project, and then delete it.</p><p>like <code>yarn add javascript-email-templates</code> and just use one or a few templates imported.</p><p>Or you can use a statement like,</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">if(NODE_ENV == 'production') {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    // send a test email to an admin</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="copyButton_eDfN clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_W9eQ" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_XEyF" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_i9w9" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div><p>and it will work for a lot of cases</p><p>The second repository can be more interesting.</p><p>Basically, I copy-pasted a render method from other repositories. Yes, they has "free to use and modify" license.</p><p>I want to extend and isolate that render method, so it can be an independent package, suit our project needs and be easy to customize, if necessary (there is always a need to customize things. you can't make it work from the first shot).</p><p>Show some love if you want more articles like this one! any activity will be appreciated.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2022-03-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me share a story about building React Components for emails and the email generator that I created.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me share a story about building React Components for emails and the email generator that I created.</p><p>Here you can find a lot of information about my obsession.</p><p>I want to focus on my findings about React, building email campaigns, and sharing things that most of the developers need.</p><p>I started the second branch of our repository; I created a basic clean Nextjs app, set of components and used this application as a preview of the emails tool.</p><p>Yeah, it was easy in the beginning. You will make tremendous progress; with this application, it is easy to produce reports, questions are easy to solve, etc.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6valqprc6se0x437iz6x.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>It was a good milestone. I was angry and happy at the same time. You can't get a result without hitting blockers.</p><p>The next stage was a few months ago. I decided to jump into it. There are no bugs that I can't handle :)</p><p>As I was not the leading developer of this branch - I quickly realized that it was a rigid structure for me to follow. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lg66itl8kx0a4fqb0flh.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I will move some components into a sub-module (I will see where this idea brings me.) </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/js65g5dbnfqzkgfojv9x.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>This shouldn't be hard. I did it before, with the help of Rollup. So I grabbed my own two years old rollup config that was working with simple react components. And tried to make it work.</p><p>I tried three times -&gt; nothing worked as it should :)</p><p>Well, things changed - my old config didn't work well with the new version of Babel and React.&nbsp;</p><p>It was time to dig into Rollup and solve this problem.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RollupJS</a> is a popular tool and good library that I adore.</p><p>But documentation was really outdated… The maintainer of this project has a lot of things to do, so docs have very low priority. </p><p>That is is why capitalism is king, and open source is still slow, weak, and not bringing a lot of money into the system and can't support code contributors. </p><p>This was one of the reasons for me thinking about doing a software specifications service. But there is a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karl Huges</a>, with <a href="http://www.writer.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WriterDev</a> website, where you can use his help if you need excellent software documentation.</p><p>And I am not blaming <a href="https://github.com/lukastaegert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lukas Taegert-Atkinson</a>(creator of RollupJS). But if he decides to expand the team that building it, things probably would be much easier.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/snx6j3lcb8zmbyw4gk6m.gif" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I left the task for a few weeks and just explored the internet in a lazy way.</p><p>At one point, <a href="https://github.com/jaebradley/example-rollup-react-component-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I found a repository</a> that sounds reasonable with a config that suits my needs. It even provides room for future growth.</p><p>I was looking for a Rollup setup with Babel and the ability to compile and publish my React components.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes. I'm aware of <a href="https://bit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bit</a> or other similar tools, but they are somehow against my understanding. Again, I'm scared of Webpack. I mentioned it a few times on my articles. </p><p>But I'm still ready for something better. This is why I'm exploring the <a href="https://lit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lit Library</a> at the same time. It is still not in my arsenal but looks promising.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5frn4uieb6uiu0ayitml.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Separation functionality is one of the things that I've been praising for the last few years, probably because I read a lot of articles on Hackernoon on different languages, platforms, functions, etc. And when your code is tied up with just one project, with just one framework, used only once, it's boring, it is life, so I get on with it. </p><p>But where can we find anarchy and punk rock? You can beat the system by benefiting from an open source at the same time.</p><p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/WsvLlmmjx9tnmeTPNc/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://media.giphy.com/media/WsvLlmmjx9tnmeTPNc/giphy.gif</a></p><p>Plus, hard-to-swallow code is usually wrong. Usually hard to cover with tests. Easy to spend a week, just by debugging, patching, and ready to break in the next six months.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it's just not for me. Bad code is too easy to build.</p><p>Hopefully, now you'll understand a bit my coding philosophy.</p><p>Again, I find <a href="https://github.com/jaebradley/example-rollup-react-component-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an excellent repository</a> with the premade setup as my components have pretty low-level complexity.</p><p>But there is more:</p><ul><li><p>it has pre-made Github actions for publishing on npm</p></li><li><p>storybook for playgrounds</p></li><li><p>and tools that I need when I want a separate module of components that I can easily tweak, extend, publish and install in between projects, repositories.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itu81kmwbzy6kqppp1og.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I did a few iterations there, combined some components, and published them on npm.org.</p><p>But it still does not move forward quickly, as I imagine it in my head.</p><p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/eNGuf8kUCeGrvflJfo/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://media.giphy.com/media/eNGuf8kUCeGrvflJfo/giphy.gif</a></p><p>Let's take a break a little bit. There is a default question that my friend Denis asked me.&nbsp;</p><p><em>"But emails aren't a new problem. React isn't a new tool as well. There should probably be plenty of other repositories in GitHub. Did you look at them?"</em></p><p>And I spent a few nights just exploring GitHub and got excited about it.</p><p>But there are always default issues related to using other modules.&nbsp;</p><p><em>This is why I like to have separated and independent modules</em></p><p>Yes, there are old, popular repositories that can have similar tools inside. The reason is always simple - they didn't fit well to our current code. It is not their fault.</p><p>It's a widespread issue - you can't easily integrate something great and prebuild with the workflows you have. So instead of trying some of them right now, I'm just stacking links in my notes.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdbb98rzjv941n6dh6qu.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Even while I have a lot of ideas - the main goal is to make the current project work. Later, when our modules will be mature - we will try to replace some functionality.</p><p>We did it before - a pretty incredible experience.</p><p>I talk about popular repositories to build emails with some algorithms, I mean JS stuff for building emails. It's <a href="https://maizzle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maizzle</a>, <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/feature/mjml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MJML</a>, and others. So later, if things go smoothly - we'll add a port to those libraries. </p><p>Our email generator is “syntax agnostic”. if you learn it, I can generate you HTML, React DOM, XML, or even AST-tree</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gdj25b7j1ljxjtmc8krz.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>One of my concerns is that the current library must be improved. A few great repositories are doing similar things, but they are aging poorly. For sure, it's not a problem, but I will make it differently.</p><p>From another side, I want to use their logic and be able to include some of their excellent findings into our core.</p><p>This is why I decided not to have one boring repository and started splitting it.</p><p>I also started a <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new organization on Github</a> as a unique place for several repositories interconnected by email marketing topic and email template generation.</p><p>I split an old repository into a just react components place. And old components were mixed mostly on one template. Now, I want to get a universal version. And by separating inner with outer things, separating default components with Miscellaneous Elements helped to think more widely and make things work together and independently.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oif42hceyf5v3erj116p.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>So if you decide to use our components for your emails, you can install <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail/react-email-table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Table components</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail/react-email-typography-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basic Typography</a> components and use them while not being overwhelmed with other available components (like bid design systems like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ant Design</a>). It was the main image in my head.</p><p><a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NextJS</a> is used as a preview, repositories with separated  components. What is next? Well. I will jump into the next loophole that will distracted me for another few months. it will help me to optimize that code.</p><p>I am going to write more articles about that.</p><p><strong>Related Articles</strong>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was rebuilding a part of our <a href="https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-to-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">markdown-to-email</a> repository. I was not happy with how we handle templates in our generator.</p><p>While there are not many things that changed behind how it works, I still want to showcase them in my article.</p><p>All developers work with strings, generating chunks of HTML code. I spend days thinking about how to improve it for our benefit.</p><p>While this version of the template will be obsolete when we upgrade our generator, there is still room to forget some knowledge and learn how to keep things simple and not be seduced by ideas to complete it quickly.</p><p>So we have been working on rendering HTML for a while right now. </p><p>Our HTML template contains an old HTML4 style markup that is very sensitive and requires careful work and attention to small details. I have been asking for help from different developers, but everybody struggles with it from the beginning. </p><p>So we are combining that HTML page from small parts, and for the last nine months, I moved those parts away into a small js module. </p><p>With the help of RollupJS, it's easy to work.</p><p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/62g0ie0unri1ad1aoy8k.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I was able to extend it and even clone it. I decided to build a react-dom tree at some point instead of HTML. </p><p>So I copy-pasted everything and replaced my literals with react tags. It looks like “custom XML”, which can be just another way of presenting the information.</p><p>After that, this module didn't evolve a lot. Everything was working ok, but not ideally. I tried to expand it and polish our functionality, but things didn't move fast. </p><p>This module was located in folder "packages" with other modules that I have.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xqep0y6lxflgsireezp3.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>At this point, I decided that there was a lot of coding, and I was sick of it. So I created a new repository and moved it there. While it was just a copy-paste - it helped me to think differently. I was able to focus only on those 25 files.</p><p>From the beginning, we think about our template in 2 only forms: "content only" and "full template". Most bugs was in the "content" part, while the main template was pretty stable. But it was hard to go from "content only" into "full template" sometimes - we don't have an easy way to preview it or debug.</p><p>So I separated our 25 files into two parts: literals related to "not content" was named "outer template."</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ypf0uon3b80zl2230ff.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>And I decided to replace my literals with functions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ajg3lzb6mvl0uox2we0p.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Functions look similar to simple react components.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bt3qijnk6yyinrc3dww8.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>It gives me the ability to debug my strings how I want it.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wnfogb6bsqqrvbslrqt0.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I even created a folder with basic tests inside.</p><p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jjpou6ut89kdvrc3ysnp.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Hope you like it!</p><p>More articles about building markdown to email:</p><ul><li><a href="https://dev.to/atherdon/created-a-module-for-markdown-regexes-3a1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.to/atherdon/created-a-module-for-markdown-regexes-3a1b</a></li><li><a href="https://dev.to/atherdon/how-i-created-a-simple-npm-package-with-basic-email-templates-1efo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.to/atherdon/how-i-created-a-simple-npm-package-with-basic-email-templates-1efo</a></li></ul><p>UPD. I forget to add a link to a repository with a source code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While working on https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-to-email repository, we created and adapted a few cool things that I want to share with others.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A story about the need for a <a href="https://github.com/LLazyEmail/default-email-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default email template package</a>.
From novice developers to experienced ones, most are involved in sending emails programmatically. Sending emails is like building forms: most of the developers involved in building the web did it.</p><ul><li>If you are learning nodeJS, then you probably used nodemailer.</li><li>If you are building your product, I bet you are thinking about connecting your code with SendGrid or MailGun and sending some transactional emails.</li><li>If you are trying to make that sign-up form work and send confirmation emails -&gt; I hear you.</li></ul><p>We have a lot of resources and simple tutorials online that might help you to do such basic things. It is cool that you can read some tutorials, install a few packages and go! </p><p>Even starting with some SAAS boilerplate that removes the first configuration steps and gives you a great jumpstart for your ideas.</p><p>Now you can send your empty email with "Hello world" from your server and be happy when it is delivered to your inbox. And this is where most developers feel that everything is great and stop doing more.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j75251dyexl69wltd3m0.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>And while my module is written in JS, I don't think that it is a hard task to convert it into other languages if someone wants to contribute -&gt; feel free to jump abroad. I’m always friendly to contributors' pull requests.</p><p>Ok, let's try to imagine that you are building your email-related functionality, related to emails from scratch -- you will try to organize email messages in a separate folder, maybe even make it translatable into multi-languages, testing your ability to render it with variables received from other sources...</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z0wyf5qjj04719a7svvq.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>But you will probably never try to send an email with a full template from the beginning.</p><p><strong>But you should do it.</strong> </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a99g4067ltz8jqzao2ay.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>There are a lot of important questions that you have to ask yourself.
<em>Does your email template is good and render all necessary thoughts?</em>
<em>What about images? Do you have a folder with images that is available from outside?</em>
<em>Are all permissions set correctly? (Ie. not only your logo must be visible)</em>
<em>What about links?</em>
<em>What about supporting different email clients? (Yes there is not only your email app that you update frequently.)</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mhrexk9s1f5jsyk4o1dz.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Some people use Thunderbird and it disables image rendering by default (just to let you know). </p><p>All those things might crash your email. Plus, it’s an old HTML4 code, so everything is so fragile.</p><p>I was trying to solve our inner coding problem a few months ago. We had an issue with making email templates to be precise --&gt; we split them into partials, but I still didn't like what my stomach was telling me about manipulating with markup emails.</p><p>But that is a story for another article. And it was time for me to be inspired by other developers.</p><p>I reviewed a few repositories during one night. I found a few basic, but interesting solutions.</p><p>While our render method was working well for our needs -&gt; it didn't give you this feeling of quickly understanding what your code is doing.</p><p>We didn't have it.</p><p>So I saved links and copied a few methods into temporary files.</p><p>It was not enough, especially as our problem was not gone anyway. At that moment I realized that a lot of projects might have similar issues. Imagine this situation: you have your monolith application and you need to send a test email via your Email Transport provider.</p><p>And sending a few blank emails with 2 lines is not enough either. We all need a quick and easy way to do it properly without additional knowledge. One of the best ways is to use a predefined working solution. So I decided to make it an open JS module and easy to use for everyone.</p><p>And I created two repositories for that :)</p><p>The first repository contains 3 files. And it's easy to read. Just a long string aka literal with an email template inside.</p><p>What's good about this repository is that you can install it via npm, use it a few times, while debugging your project, and then delete it.</p><p>like <code>yarn add javascript-email-templates</code> and just use one or a few templates imported.</p><p>Or you can use a statement like,</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">if(NODE_ENV == 'production') {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    // send a test email to an admin</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="copyButton_eDfN clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_W9eQ" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_XEyF" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_i9w9" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div><p>and it will work for a lot of cases</p><p>The second repository can be more interesting.</p><p>Basically, I copy-pasted a render method from other repositories. Yes, they has "free to use and modify" license.</p><p>I want to extend and isolate that render method, so it can be an independent package, suit our project needs and be easy to customize, if necessary (there is always a need to customize things. you can't make it work from the first shot).</p><p>Show some love if you want more articles like this one! any activity will be appreciated.</p>]]></content>
