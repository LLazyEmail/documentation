### Major Release steps
- complete table repo 
- work on typography repository
- to check what is going on with the NextJS preview repository
- to review the current state of the HN template and what is necessary to complete in order to meet our goals

- at the same time, maybe it will be easier to complete & release a few "billing" templates that we have.


I started to organize information on our documentation website.


Separating and organizing templates into a better code
naming we react templates and organizing repositories

---

My goal a year ago was to clean up our markdown-to-email repository. 
We have a 2nd branch, packed with react stuff, now it's separated but needs input to finish things.

A generator is using the outer template and inner components(Interior) separately.  
This is why we split things that way. While the generator is creating content dynamically, the outer template is static.
