## 2. Executable commands drives me crazy


### 1. I need a command for updating subpackages quickly. 
for it i created a [script](https://github.com/LLazyEmail/nomoretogo_email_template/blob/main/bash/update-packages.sh) and it works awesome for me




### 2. i want to try to use meow for that, but i think it's too much for a pretty simple code that we are trying to have

### 3. i need to have a script for calling test files separately, when i'm debugging things
