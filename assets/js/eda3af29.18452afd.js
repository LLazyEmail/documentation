However, before we dive into curated newsletters, let\'s first touch on the basics of newsletters, in general.\\n\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oq9pd64gj1e49s44yjxb.png)\\n\\n## How can I start an email newsletter for a company?\\n\\nBefore a company dives into creating curated newsletters, it needs to have a solid understanding of what an email newsletter is. \\n\\nAn email newsletter is an email communication that is sent to inform your subscribers about various topics, such as:\\n- Latest news\\n- Advice\\n- Product updates / launches\\n- Important appointments\\n\\nThese emails can cover general topics and user-generated topics that are sent on a predetermined schedule, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.\\n\\nStarting an email newsletter isn\'t all that difficult, especially if you\'ve already created a list of email users. \\n\\nFrom there, you\'ll simply have to send opt-in emails to your subscribers to make sure they want to receive your marketing materials, and once that\'s done you can start sending them according to your predetermined schedule.\\n\\nStarting an email newsletter isn\'t that difficult, especially if you\'ve already built a list of email users. \\n\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5uwti3h7w9yobdziau9e.jpg)\\n\\n## How do you make a good newsletter?\\n\\nWhat makes a good newsletter really depends on the brand, industry, and target audience. The reason for this is that everyone wants something a little different which is why they choose specific activities to follow.\\n \\nHowever, there are several ways to help your email marketing team create a newsletter that works well.\\n\\n### 1. Don\'t try to sell \\n\\nMentioning a product is one thing, as you will do it during product launches / updates, but it has to be about the reader, not you selling them something.\\n\\n### 2. Be short and simple \\nIt must be informative, also encouraging readers to click to learn more.\\n\\n### 3. Again, you should aim for a click-through\\n\\nClick through rate (CTR) is the most common metric for measuring engagement within an email campaign. CTR is a metric that measures how many people click through an email in relation to how many emails were delivered. Essentially, the click rate is a percentage that tells you how many emails successfully achieved one click from a subscriber. This click tells you if your campaign was engaging enough to not only entice an open, but also an action from your audience.\\n\\n[Source](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-click-through-rate-how-can-ctr-be-calculated/) \\n\\n### 4. Simplify deactivation(unsubscribe link). \\n\\nIt is vital to make deactivation easy for those who wish to stop receiving communications.\\n\\n### 5. Make sure it\'s compelling. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is a curated newsletter?\\nFirst of all, it is essential to understand what it means to care: to put together, sift and select for presentation.\\n\\nTherefore, a curated newsletter is one that aggregates interesting and / or popular content on a specific topic. \\n\\nCurated newsletters find the best of the best material and then collect it in one place.\\n\\nOften, along with links to external content locations, the newsletter will also offer a brief commentary or summary on the pieces.\\n\\nHere is an example from Campaign Monitor client SitePoint:\\n\\n> The newsletter curates the best web design and development content from across the web and delivers it daily to subscribers in a simple and convenient format.\\n \\n\\n## Why create a curated newsletter?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why people take a curated newsletter approach. \\n\\nFor many, it helps build their businesses:\\n\\n- Stay on top with subscribers\\n- Build thought leadership around your brand\\n- Sharing interesting discoveries and resources\\n\\n> Curated newsletters are an opportunity to offer readers a wide range of material that you have personally selected for them.\\n\\nPlus, with so much content posted on the web, a curated newsletter has serious value.\\n\\n**Choose your topic**\\nThe first step in creating your curated email newsletter is choosing your topic.\\n\\nWill your curated newsletter contain email marketing tips and tricks? \\n\\nAlternatively, will you curate content on web design trends?\\n\\nChoosing your topic is one of the most critical parts of starting a curated email newsletter."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/documentation/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus
